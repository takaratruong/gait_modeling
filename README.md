# Gait Modeling
Status: Under Heavy Development

Learn walking policies robust to perturbations via PPO or AMP (Imitation Learning).

Choice of two learning alg repos: stablebaselines, custom implementation (faster). 

Models (converted to Mujoco): walker2dv2, humanoid model, skeleton model (scaled rajagopal, torque driven), rajagopal (muscle driven).
